Q1:
--
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you
need to do it?

A:
--
It creates the hidden .git folder and sets the directory as
a git repo that needs to be tracked?
You need to do this so you can track and commit the files?

Q2:
--
How is the staging area different from the working directory
and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

A:
--
Working directory contains all files to be edited and worked on.
Staging area contains files you have finished working on and ready
to commit?

Q3:
--
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit
per logical change?

A:
--
Once you have made the logical change and saved - you would stop
working on that file to add to the staging area ready to commit.
You would also consider the commit type and subject.
