Q1:
--
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?

A:
--
If you work across multiple machines / having more than one contributor?

Q2:
--
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A:
--
If there are multiple contributors and a change is made, automatically
staying up to date could cause issues?
Manually pulling means you know exactly what you are working with?
